# Billing Semantics

The Billing Specifications are based on [OASIS UBL2.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html) [billing semantics](http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html#S-BILLING) and the [DBC implementation guides](https://github.com/ausdigital/ausdigital-syn-v1/blob/master/docs/eInvoicing_Implementation_Guide_v1.0.pdf).

* The **[Billing Process](/docs/Billing-Process.md)** specification describes how the inovice and response documents are used in six different contexts (standard invoice, rcti, tax receipt, adjustment invoice, debit note, credit note) within the overall billing state lifecycle model. 
* The **[UBL JSON Billing Documents](/docs/Billing-Documents-UBL-JSON.md)** specification describes the structure of the invoice and response documents via JSON schema and samples.  It also defines the detailed business validation rules for each profile.
* The **[UBL XML Billing Documents](/docs/Billing-Documents-UBL-XML.md)** specification describes the structure of the invoice and response documents via XSD schema libraries and samples.  It also defines the detailed business validation rules for each profile.
